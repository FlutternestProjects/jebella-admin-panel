Rules for Jebella Admin

Basic IDEA of the app here

This is a admin panel for a e-commerce platform (which foucus over selling clothing stuff and accessories for men, women, e.t.c) named as Jebella,
where we have:
1. admin (platform owner of Jebella, will have full access)
2. sellers (they will have the some different access then the main admin)

Code should be maintainable, sepration of concern, reuasable, productive, effiecient, flexible.
SOLID Priciple use.
 I want to maintain consistency throughout the codebase. This is an admin and seller panel, so things would be similar (mostly CRUD). 

 we need proper pagination along with search in every feature will coming in future or over which we are working over now.
 make reuable things if you think.
 use existing patterens for consistency.
